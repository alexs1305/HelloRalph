# 001 - Who is Ralph

## Summary

Create a tiny runnable script that, when executed, prints a single-line message explaining who Ralph is.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A script named `who_is_ralph.sh` is added to the repository root or `scripts/` and is executable.
2. Running the script prints exactly one clear sentence describing Ralph (e.g. "Ralph is an autonomous AI coding assistant that follows spec-driven development.").
3. The repository contains a spec file `specs/001-who-is-ralph/spec.md` with the above criteria.
4. The spec's status becomes `## Status: COMPLETE` only after the script exists, is executable, and prints the required line.

## Status: COMPLETE

## Notes

- Keep it minimal and portable (POSIX `sh` compatible).
